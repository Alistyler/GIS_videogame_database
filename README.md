# GIS_videogame_database

I want to list a bunch of video games that I played and I want to play and I never even heard about before. 
Additionally my database shall be a little bit interactive in sort of writing comments etc.
Within the list you have access to a few detail that is known about this game like release date or a quick resume etc.
Thus everyone can search for the game they want to play or maybe they find a game they didn't even heard before.
